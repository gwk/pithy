def path_encode(string:str) -> str:
  '''
  Encode string into a path.
  Path encoding is similar to url percent encoding, but uses '+' as the indicator character.
  It is used to create convenient file names out of URLs.
  Like URL encoding, letters, digits, and the characters '_.-' are left unescaped.
  Additionally:
  * A leading '.' is escaped to prevent hidden files from being created.
  * '%' characters are not escaped, to make prior URL encoding more readable.
  * ':' characters are not escaped to make URL schemes more readable.
  * '=' characters are not escaped.
  * '/' is translated to ',', which allows multiple path segments in the url to be squashed into a single filename.
  * Note that ',' is itself encoded, so the encoding is unambiguous.
  * All other bytes are encoded as "+XX", where XX is the uppercase hexadecimal byte value.

  Return a path encoded from a url by first splitting the url into parts

  Empty parts are represented by a bare '+'.

  `split_path`: if True, the path is translated into nested directories.
  Otherwise, slashes are translated into commas.

  * `OMIT` causes that part to be omitted;
  * `SQUASH` causes it to be squashed into the previous path component;
  * `COMP` causes it to be appended as a distinct path component;
  * `SPLIT` is only valid for `path`, and splits the path into components.
