# Patterns

// These rules fail if the ambiguous rule check is performed on the fat DFA,
// presumably because of the way that star rules are transformed into distinct states.
// However it passes when the check is done on the minimized DFA.
// This test also causes the "patterns cannot be correctly ordered" warning to be emitted.
